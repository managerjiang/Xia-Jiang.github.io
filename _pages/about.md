I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management (SYEEM)](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/) at [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/), hosted by [Anthony Man-Cho So](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-so-man-cho-anthony/). My research interest includes distributed optimization, minimax optimization and federated learning.

Previously, I received my Ph.D. degree in the National Key Lab of Autonomous
Intelligent Unmanned Systems from [School of Automation](https://ac.bit.edu.cn/) from Beijing Institute of Technology(BIT) in 2023, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jie Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bRgX19EAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I also worked closely with [Prof. Jian Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_Cr-_0cAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Prof. Xianlin Zeng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S4KS0noAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). From Sep 2021 to Aug 2022, I worked with [Prof. Lihua Xie](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/elhxie/) as a visiting Ph.D. student in [School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/eee) at Nanyang Technological University. Prior to joining BIT, I obtained my bachelor degree in Control Science and Engineering from Shandong University.
