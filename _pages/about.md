I'm a postdoc from [School of SYEEM], [Chinese University of Hong Kong]. My research interest includes distributed optimization, minimax optimization and federated learning.
From 2017-2023, I was advised by [Prof. Jie Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bRgX19EAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) of the National Key Lab of Autonomous
Intelligent Unmanned Systems from [School of Automation], Beijing Institute of Technology. From 2021-2022, I was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Lihua Xie](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/elhxie/) from [School of EEE](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/eee), Nanyang Technological University.
